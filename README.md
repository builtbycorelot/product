Product Catalog for CORELOT Homes

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Generate the metadata store (optional, runs automatically on first start):
   ```bash
   npm run generate-metadata
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The client will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Connecting to the Metadata Store

The metadata is stored in `metadata.json` at the project root. It is generated by
parsing the image files in this directory. The generation logic can be found in
`scripts/generateMetadata.js` which also exports two utility functions:

- `validatePhoto(filePath)` – verifies image existence and extension.
- `collectMetadata(dir)` – collects metadata from a directory of images.

The server uses this JSON file to provide the `/api/products` endpoint and serve
images from the `/images` path.
