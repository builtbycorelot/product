Product Catalog for CORELOT Homes

## 3D Home Configure Module & Catalog
To help homebuyers make more informed decisions during the home design process,
we now have Product Detail Pages for appliances to provide more product information including images, highlights, and specifications. This feature will be available by the end of May.

We've added a new suite of tools to the BFS National Catalog to help you customize configurations, enforce standards, and prepare for future ERP integrations.

## Running the catalog
Open `index.html` in a web browser to launch the JavaScript module from the page itself.
